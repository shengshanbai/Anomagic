## 📊 Introduction  
In industrial point cloud analysis, detecting subtle anomalies demands high-resolution spatial data, yet prevailing benchmarks emphasize low-resolution inputs. To address this disparity, we propose a scalable pipeline for generating realistic and subtle 3D anomalies. Employing this pipeline, we developed **MiniShift**, the inaugural high-resolution 3D anomaly detection dataset, encompassing 2,577 point clouds, each with 500,000 points and anomalies occupying less than 1% of the total. We further introduce **Simple3D**, an efficient framework integrating Multi-scale Neighborhood Descriptors (MSND) and Local Feature Spatial Aggregation (LFSA) to capture intricate geometric details with minimal computational overhead, achieving real-time inference exceeding 20 fps. Extensive evaluations on **MiniShift** and established benchmarks demonstrate that **Simple3D** surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and speed, highlighting the pivotal role of high-resolution data and effective feature aggregation in advancing practical 3D anomaly detection.
